I designed and developed a Diabetes Prediction System using various attributes such as – general health, mental health, physical health, age, education, income to predict whether a person is diabetic or not. We use various models such as Logistic Classifier, KNN Classifier, SVM Classifier, Kernel SVM Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier to predict the same.
